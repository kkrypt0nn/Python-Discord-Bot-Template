## All code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Keep consistency with the current state of the codebase, this includes but is not limited to naming convention, Discord embeds, etc.
3. Format the code of the **Python** files you've edited with the **black** formatter and **all others** with the **Prettier** formatter.
4. Sort the imports with `isort`
5. Issue that pull request!

## Commit messages guidelines

This project uses [`Conventional Commits 1.0.0`](https://conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) hence your commit messages **must** follow the same convention or your contributions will be ignored, refused or assigned to another user or maintainer.

## Create a GitHub [Issue](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/issues) and **then** a pull request

Start contributing by first [opening a new issue](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/issues/new/choose). Once that is done, you can create a pull request for the issue.

Your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/blob/main/LICENSE.md) that covers the project.
